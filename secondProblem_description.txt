In this problem, The program gets a txt file as an input which contains all the updates recieved at the server
(each update is a json that takes one line).

The first thing the program do is to iterate through the file and create/start a thread for each json object (line).

There is static variable in the program called "userValuesWithTime", this is the most important as all threads write to it.
userValuesWithTime is a ConcurrentDictionary which is a special type of dictionary designed to be thread-safe so that all thread can write/read it.
It should contain each user with their key values, each key value has a list with all the values and their corresponding timestamp.

After all the threads finish (writing to "userValuesWithTime"), the program thens call a method called "printOutput" which created an object named output and then prinit it.
In this method, only the values with the biggest timestamp is stored, to make sure it is the latest value.

NOTE: I used a ConcurrentStack instead of a list because it is thread-safe, at the "printOutput" method I convert it to array so that I can iterate through
it and get the maximum timestamp.
