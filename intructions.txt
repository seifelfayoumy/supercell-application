This is the instructions to build the program.

This is a C# DotNet program, so you need to have dotnet installed on your machine to run the program. 
(https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

To run the program simply go to the directory and type "dotnet run" then the filepath afterwards.

To run the first problem on Mac, type this in the terminal: (you should write the full path to the file)
cd FirstProblem
dotnet run <InputFilePath>

so in my machine for example, I do the following:
cd FirstProblem
dotnet run /Users/seifelfayoumy/development/SupercellApplication/tests/ex1/input1.txt

It is the same for the second problem, for example:
cd SecondProblem
dotnet run /Users/seifelfayoumy/development/SupercellApplication/tests/ex2/input1.txt
